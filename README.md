I'm a developer with a passion for bringing ideas to life through code. I have experience in PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Java for web development, as well as Java and Swift for mobile development. I enjoy creating innovative and efficient solutions and find motivation in seeing the results.

My journey in software development is driven by curiosity and a constant desire to learn and grow. It's amazing how a few lines of code can impact the lives of thousands of people. During my time at Videosoft, I had the opportunity to participate in the entire process, from conceiving the business idea to developing and launching the product in the market. We made continuous improvements and evolved the product to a scale where it now processes over 100 million Reais in orders every month, benefiting hundreds of businesses and thousands of consumers across Brazil. This journey culminated in an incredible partnership with iFood, Brazil's delivery giant(in 2023 they had revenues of 110.7 billion, 0,55% of Brazil's GDP*), in August 2024. Our solution is now being resold by this national giant after successfully impacting the market.
